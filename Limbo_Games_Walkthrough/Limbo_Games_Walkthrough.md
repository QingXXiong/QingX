## Overview

Limbo is a puzzle game, telling a story about a boy on a mission to find his sister by going through a dozen of challenges. It's dark and surreal with great sound and clever gaming design. If you are a sucker for these things but feel the game is challenging to play, then you're in the right place.

Before you start, you need:

- A copy of Limbo. Or else, buy or rent it. For how to get Limbo as you want, check out [Buy Limbo](playdead.com/games/limbo/).
- One of these:
  - A keyboard or a controller for playing on a computer.
  - A controller for playing on a game console.
  - A device with a touchscreen, like a mobile phone or Nintendo Switch.

Limbo has 40 _Chapters_. To check which chapter you playing, in the game, go to __Menu__ > __Load Chapter__, then you'll see the current chapter. To navigate through chapters, use the right/left action as you play games. Note you can only navigate to a chapter where you complete all the challenges.

## How to read the walkthrough

This walkthrough aims to help you get through chapters in Limbo. So, to make the most out of the walkthrough, you need to know:

- The structure of walkthrough.
- The basic actions you can do, like jumping and grabbing.
- The objects commonly used in the game, like levers, elevators, and crates.

You can just dive into _How to avoid useless dying_ right away. But better skim through them, so you won't say F words in case lost in the walkthrough.

### The structure of walkthrough

We divide the 40 chapters into 21 _sections_, with each section including 2-3 chapters. For each section, the structure of walkthrough is like this:

### The basic actions you can do

Here are basic actions you can do, regardless which device you use (the ways to use them might be different):

- Go Right
- Go Left
- Go Up
- Go Down
- Grab

Also, you can have these combined actions:

- Jump Over: Go Right/Left + Jump, for something like a gap
- Swing Across: Go Right/Left + Grab, for something like ropes or chains
- Pull: Go Right/Left/Up/Down + Grab, for something like a bear trap or a lever

Something to note:

- You can use Go Up to jump up or Go Down to jump down.
- You can Go Up to climb up or Go Down to climb down:
- If you have something like a box blocking your move, Using Go Right/Left will push it.
- When you Jump Over something like a bear trap, keep a distance (like the distance the boy walks in three steps) from it, do Go Right/Left, then Jump when near to it.
- When you Swing Across something like a gap, use Go Right/Left to grab something for landing.
- After grabbing a rope, if the gap to jump is too big, ensure you dangle back and forth to get closer to the landing side.
- You can also use Grab to turn a switch.
- "Pull a trap right" means "push a trap right when standing on the left side of trap". You get the idea.?

From now on, we will only use the basic and combined actions. For example, "Grab the switch" means "turn the switch", "Go Up the ladder" means "grab and climb up the ladder".

Why? It's concise, clear, and consistent. You don't want to die when following confusing steps, right?

### The objects commonly used

Here is a cheat sheet with quips for you.

| Object name | Good to know |
| :--- | :--- |

## How to avoid useless dying

Almost every gamer has been dead at least once, I mean, in a game. Playing games is a try-and-true process, so to pass a game, you will die from a few times to lots of times, depending on how hard the game is. But the thing is, we need to get rid of useless dying. You grumble about failing to jump over in a game but indeed miss pre-run for jumping. This is a good example of useless dying.

If you want to get a sense of achievement but not frustration, ask yourself these questions:

- Do you figure out the mechanics of an action? On Limbo, incorrect Jump Over gives you a hard time playing.
- Are you really doing actions correctly? Don't say a game is shitty because you're shitty.
- How many times have you been trying the same actions but failed? Failing more than three times often means you are doing wrong.
- How long have you been playing a game? Long time playing a game, especially a hard one, wears you out.
- Do you say "Yes, I can do it"? Some games need your stamina and patience in a short time, so better push yourself a bit.

Well, we have talked about a lot, it's time for game on and to start playing.
