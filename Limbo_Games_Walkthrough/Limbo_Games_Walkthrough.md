## Overview

Limbo is a puzzle game, telling a story about a boy on a mission to find his sister by going through a dozen of challenges. It's dark and surreal with great sound and atmosphere, and clever gaming design. If you are a sucker for these things but feel the game is challenging to play, then you're in the right place.

Before starting, you need:

- A copy of Limbo. Or else, buy or rent it. For how to get Limbo on your favorite platform, check out [Buy Limbo](playdead.com/games/limbo/).
- One of these:
  - A keyboard or a controller for playing on a computer.
  - A controller for playing on a game console.
  - A device with a touchscreen, like a mobile phone or Nintendo Switch.

Limbo has 40 _Chapters_. To check which chapter you are playing, in the game, go to __Menu__ > __Load Chapter__ to see the current chapter. To navigate through chapters, use the right/left action for playing the game. Note you can only navigate to a chapter where you complete all the challenges.

## How to read the walkthrough

This walkthrough aims to help you get through chapters in Limbo. So, to make the most out of the walkthrough, you need to know:

- The structure of walkthrough.
- The basic actions you can do, like jumping and grabbing.
- The objects commonly used in the game, like levers, elevators, and crates.

Skim through these things before diving into the walkthrough, so you won't say F words in case you are lost.

### The structure of walkthrough

The 40 chapters are divided into 21 _sections_, with each section including 1-3 chapters. For each section, the structure of walkthrough is like this:

----

### The basic actions you can do

Here are basic actions you can do, regardless which device you use (the ways to use them might be different):

- Go Right
- Go Left
- Go Up
- Go Down
- Grab

Also, you have these combined actions:

- Jump Over: Go Right/Left + Go Up, for something like a gap
- Pull: Go Right/Left + Grab, for something like a bear trap or a lever

However, the Grab action is automatic when:

- Reaching something like ropes, ladders, chains, and platforms
- Pushing something right ahead of you

One thing you need to pay attention is the momentum mechanics. What's momentum? Gaining speeds to go cross a big gap or something. Limbo requires a lot of prerun or dangling for getting through, otherwise you might die lots of times.

Here are 2 cases where you need to get momentum and the actions:

- Swinging with something like a rope: dangling, that's, Go Left and Right
- Jump Over something like a bear trap: keeping a distance, like the distance the boy walks in three steps

Something to note:

- Use Go Up to jump up or Go Down to jump down
- Go Up to climb up or Go Down to climb down
- Use Grab to turn on/off something
- Swing = dangle + Jump Over
- Swing and Push are not combined actions because Grab is automatic

From now on, the basic and combined actions will be used in camel case to describe actions to do, that's, the case of _Go Up_. Swing and Push are also used in camel case as a reminder.

Why? It's concise, clear, and consistent. You don't want to die when following confusing steps, right?

### The objects commonly used

Here is a cheat sheet with quips for you.

| Object name | Good to know |
| :--- | :--- |
| Logs | always help you get through a gap...most of the time |
| Spikes | don't fall on them, it's too painful to die |
| Ropes/chains | it's a God's hand, so hold tight |
| Boxes | the magic cube for almost everything |
| Bear traps | not just for bears |
| Spiders | scary but you can pull its leg |
| boulders | who play such a big ball |
| Trunks | not that handy at all |
| Platforms | so smooth yet so rough |
| Carts | no time for shopping |
| Gears | ride its teeth |
| Brain slugs | tell me where to go |
| Waters | it's not hot water, but it is |
| Blocks | don't have a crush on them |
| Button | not for your clothes |
| Elevators | something fishy with it |
| Levers | no level up |
| Switches | Switch, or else |
| Saws | saw a saw, jump |
| Guns | shoot me if you can |
| Ladders | no jump scare |
| Pipes | hollowly dangerous |
| Slug eaters | I love slugs |

## How to avoid useless dying

Almost every gamer has been dead at least once, I mean, in a game. Playing games is a try-and-true process, so to pass a game, you will die from a few times to lots of times, depending on how hard the game is. But the thing is, you need to get rid of useless dying. You grumble about failing to jump over in a game but indeed miss pre-run for jumping. This is a good example of useless dying.

If you want to get a sense of achievement but not frustration, ask yourself these questions:

- Do you figure out the mechanics of an action? On Limbo, incorrect Jump Over gives you a hard time playing.
- Are you really doing actions correctly? Don't say a game is shitty because you're shitty.
- How many times have you been trying the same actions but failed? Failing more than three times often means you are doing wrong.
- How long have you been playing a game? Long time playing a game, especially a hard one, wears you out.
- Do you say "Yes, I can do it"? Some games need your stamina and patience in a short time, so better push yourself a bit.

Well, enough talking, it's time for game on and to start playing.
