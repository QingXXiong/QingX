You will need your personal Authentication Key to use DeepL Pro with memoQ 8.5 or higher. This key can be found on your DeepL Pro Account page.

There are several ways to use the DeepL Pro plug-in: you can pre-translate automatically, you can translate single files, or you can create a new project. What follows is a description of how to set up a project without pre-translation.

*You can use the DeepL Pro plug-in to:

------

To begin, select the option "Create new project from template."

*To set up a project without pre-translation, you can:

⇨ Add the documents (or folder of documents) to translate and click "Next."

⇨ In the next window, select the source and target languages.

⇨ Whether you create a project from a template or a completely new one, all machine translation (MT) resources must be active. While these resources are active by default, you can check if MT resources are active: Click on "Review settings" under “Resources,” and check that "MT settings" shows "all."

⇨ Click "Finish."

------

- Under __Resource__, ensure __MT settings__ is __all__ by default, which means all machine translation (MT) resources are active. Note that __MT settings__ must be __all__ whether you create a project from a template or not.

- Click __Finish__.

------

Once the project has been created, go to "Settings," at the bottom of the "Project home" menu (on the left of the screen), and then go to "MT settings." Click on the option "Create/use new."

------

Once the project is created, you can:

- Click __Create/use new__.

------

⇨ Give this new resource a name (e.g. "DeepL Pro Plug-in").

⇨ Now, click on the option "Edit" and the window "Edit machine translation settings" will appear. Under the "Services" tab, you will find "DeepL MT Plug-in."

------

- Under __Name__, enter a name for a new MT resource, and under __Description__, describe the resource, then click __OK__.

Note: You can ignore a warning about data privacy.

To the right of the document, the "Translation results" window will show the automatic translations from DeepL, which you can use and edit directly in the target language segment.

These translations will be saved in your translation memories for future use.
