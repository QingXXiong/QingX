# On writing docs

Hello! Welcome to my place for writing docs.

My name is Qing Xiong.

## How I do write

3 top tasks in writing (not designing or testing) docs:

- Tell how: to do things like how to set up an account.
- Tell what: to give things like a concept or an idea.
- Tell why: to explain things like a concept, a process or an action.

Writing docs:

- User-ly: think like users
- Accurately: give facts and correct steps
- Clearly: use plain languages

### Write user-ly

- Use "you" to address users.
- Write like talking to someone.
- Avoid "please" most of the time.
- Use acronyms/abbreviation

### Write accurately

### Write clearly

- For actions, say __where to do__ + __how__ +/- __purpose__ +/- __useful bonus actions__.
- For giving links, specify __why the link is needed__.
-
