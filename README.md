# Hello! Welcome to my place for technical writing

My name is Qing Xiong. I love English so much, and I am really mad about why I am Chinese.

I follow these best practices for technical writing if I can (or else):

1. Use simple words, tenses, and structures.
2. Triangle important info - put important info on the front of sentences, paragraphs, or articles.
3. For actions, say __where + how +/- purpose +/- useful bonus actions__.
4. For explanation, say how you understand.
5. Use active voice and unneeded fillers.
6. Use lists and tables.
7. Define users with a statement.
